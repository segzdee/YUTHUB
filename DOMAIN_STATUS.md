# YUTHUB Domain Status

## Current Status: Domain Purchased, Ready for Hostinger Configuration

### Working URLs (Current)

- **Development Server**: http://localhost:5000
- **Replit Domain**: https://27891fa9-b276-4e4e-a11a-60ce998c53b2-00-2uromwtwyow5n.janeway.replit.dev

### Production Domain (Purchased on Hostinger)

- **Target Domain**: https://www.yuthub.com
- **Status**: Domain purchased, needs DNS configuration
- **Registrar**: Hostinger

## Why www.yuthub.com Shows "Not Found"

The domain www.yuthub.com is not live because:

1. ✅ **Domain Purchased**: yuthub.com purchased on Hostinger
2. ❌ **DNS Records**: Need to configure A records to point to your server
3. ❌ **Hosting Setup**: Need to deploy application to a server
4. ❌ **SSL Certificate**: HTTPS requires SSL certificates for the domain

## What's Been Configured

✅ **Application Code**: Fully configured for www.yuthub.com
✅ **OAuth Callbacks**: Updated for production domain
✅ **SEO & Meta Tags**: All pointing to www.yuthub.com
✅ **CORS Settings**: Production-ready
✅ **Session Management**: Configured for yuthub.com domain
✅ **Deployment Scripts**: Ready for production

## Next Steps to Make www.yuthub.com Live with Hostinger

### Option 1: Use Hostinger Web Hosting

1. **Purchase Hostinger Web Hosting** (if not already done)
2. **Upload Application Files** to Hostinger's file manager
3. **Configure Node.js** on Hostinger (if supported)
4. **Set Environment Variables** in Hostinger's control panel
5. **Configure DNS** automatically (Hostinger handles this)

### Option 2: Use External Server + Hostinger DNS

1. **Deploy to Cloud Provider** (AWS, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean)
2. **Configure DNS in Hostinger**:
   ```
   A Record: www.yuthub.com → [SERVER_IP]
   A Record: yuthub.com → [SERVER_IP]
   ```
3. **Set Up SSL** (Let's Encrypt or cloud provider SSL)
4. **Deploy Application**: `./deploy.sh`

### Option 3: Use Replit Deployment + Custom Domain

1. **Deploy on Replit** (easiest option)
2. **Add Custom Domain** in Replit settings
3. **Configure DNS in Hostinger**:
   ```
   CNAME: www.yuthub.com → [REPLIT_DOMAIN]
   ```

## Current Working Application

Your application is fully functional and can be accessed at:

- **Local**: http://localhost:5000 (when running `npm run dev`)
- **Replit**: https://27891fa9-b276-4e4e-a11a-60ce998c53b2-00-2uromwtwyow5n.janeway.replit.dev

## Alternative: Use Replit Deployment

Instead of purchasing a domain, you can deploy directly on Replit:

1. Click "Deploy" in Replit
2. Your app will be available at a replit.app subdomain
3. You can later add a custom domain if needed

The application is production-ready - it just needs a live domain and hosting setup.
