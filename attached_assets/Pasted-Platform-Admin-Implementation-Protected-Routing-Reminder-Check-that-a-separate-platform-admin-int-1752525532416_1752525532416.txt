Platform Admin Implementation & Protected Routing Reminder:
Check that a separate platform admin interface is implemented with protected routing at /platform-admin/* URLs requiring super-admin authentication and role-based access control distinct from organization-level admin users, verify that platform admin authentication uses multi-factor authentication (MFA) and IP whitelisting for enhanced security, ensure that subscription management features include viewing all organization subscriptions, processing upgrades/downgrades, managing billing cycles, applying discounts, and handling subscription cancellations across all clients, confirm that platform monitoring includes real-time system health dashboards, database performance metrics, API response times, error rates, and uptime statistics across all tenants, validate that organization management allows creating new client organizations, configuring their initial setup, managing their subscription tiers, and viewing their usage analytics, check that platform-wide analytics display revenue metrics, subscription conversion rates, feature adoption across tiers, customer churn analysis, and growth trends, ensure that system administration includes database management tools, backup monitoring, security audit logs, user session management across all organizations, and system configuration updates, verify that the platform admin interface is completely separate from organization dashboards with distinct authentication flows and no cross-contamination of permissions, confirm that support ticket management allows viewing and resolving issues across all client organizations with proper escalation workflows, validate that billing oversight includes payment processing monitoring, failed payment handling, invoice generation across all subscriptions, and revenue reporting, ensure that feature flag management allows enabling/disabling features globally or per organization for A/B testing and gradual rollouts, and check that emergency tools include the ability to disable organizations, reset passwords, perform emergency maintenance, and communicate system-wide notifications to all clients.
