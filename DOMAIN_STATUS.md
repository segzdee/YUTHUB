# YUTHUB Domain Status

## Current Status: Development Ready, Production Domain Not Live

### Working URLs (Current)
- **Development Server**: http://localhost:5000
- **Replit Domain**: https://27891fa9-b276-4e4e-a11a-60ce998c53b2-00-2uromwtwyow5n.janeway.replit.dev

### Production Domain (Not Live Yet)
- **Target Domain**: https://www.yuthub.com
- **Status**: Not Found (DNS not configured)

## Why www.yuthub.com Shows "Not Found"

The domain www.yuthub.com is not live because:

1. **Domain Not Purchased**: The domain yuthub.com needs to be purchased from a domain registrar
2. **No DNS Records**: Without DNS A records pointing to a server, the domain cannot resolve
3. **No Hosting**: No web server is configured to serve the domain
4. **No SSL Certificate**: HTTPS requires SSL certificates for the domain

## What's Been Configured

✅ **Application Code**: Fully configured for www.yuthub.com
✅ **OAuth Callbacks**: Updated for production domain
✅ **SEO & Meta Tags**: All pointing to www.yuthub.com
✅ **CORS Settings**: Production-ready
✅ **Session Management**: Configured for yuthub.com domain
✅ **Deployment Scripts**: Ready for production

## Next Steps to Make www.yuthub.com Live

### 2. Choose Hosting Provider

### 3. Configure DNS

```

## Current Working Application

Your application is fully functional and can be accessed at:
- **Local**: http://localhost:5000 (when running `npm run dev`)
- **Replit**: https://27891fa9-b276-4e4e-a11a-60ce998c53b2-00-2uromwtwyow5n.janeway.replit.dev

## Alternative: Use Replit Deployment

Instead of purchasing a domain, you can deploy directly on Replit:
1. Click "Deploy" in Replit
2. Your app will be available at a replit.app subdomain
3. You can later add a custom domain if needed

The application is production-ready - it just needs a live domain and hosting setup.
