# Authentication Fix for www.yuthub.com

## Issue Fixed: Internal Server Error on Replit Login

The authentication was failing because the system wasn't configured to handle the production domain `www.yuthub.com` properly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Authentication Strategy Registration
- Added `www.yuthub.com` to the list of supported domains
- Now registers strategies for: development, replit.dev, and www.yuthub.com

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added proper error checking for missing authentication strategies
- Added debug logging to identify authentication issues
- Improved domain detection logic

### 3. Production Environment Configuration
- Updated `.env.production` to include both domains in REPLIT_DOMAINS
- Configured proper callback URLs for production

## Current Configuration

### Supported Domains
```
- localhost (development)
- 27891fa9-b276-4e4e-a11a-60ce998c53b2-00-2uromwtwyow5n.janeway.replit.dev (replit)
- www.yuthub.com (production)
```

### Authentication Strategies
Each domain has its own authentication strategy:
- `replitauth:localhost`
- `replitauth:27891fa9-b276-4e4e-a11a-60ce998c53b2-00-2uromwtwyow5n.janeway.replit.dev`
- `replitauth:www.yuthub.com`

## Testing

To test the authentication:

1. **Development**: http://localhost:5000/api/login
2. **Replit**: https://27891fa9-b276-4e4e-a11a-60ce998c53b2-00-2uromwtwyow5n.janeway.replit.dev/api/login
3. **Production**: https://www.yuthub.com/api/login

## Next Steps

1. Verify authentication works on www.yuthub.com
2. Test the complete login flow
3. Ensure session persistence works correctly
4. Update OAuth providers if needed

The authentication system should now work properly for all three environments.
