Sign In & Sign Up Flow Implementation Reminder:
Check that the complete authentication flow is properly implemented starting with user registration that includes email verification, password strength validation, role selection (staff, admin, housing officer), organization assignment, and terms of service acceptance, verify that the sign-in process includes secure credential validation, optional multi-factor authentication (MFA), "Remember Me" functionality, and proper error handling for invalid credentials or locked accounts, ensure that email verification sends confirmation emails with secure tokens and proper expiration times, confirm that password reset flow includes secure token generation, email delivery, and proper validation before allowing password changes, validate that new user onboarding includes welcome emails, initial setup guidance, and proper role-based dashboard redirection, check that organization invitation system allows admins to invite new users with pre-assigned roles and organization association, ensure that social sign-in options (if implemented) properly map user data and maintain security standards, verify that account lockout mechanisms prevent brute force attacks with progressive delays and admin unlock capabilities, confirm that session management includes proper token expiration, refresh token handling, and secure logout that clears all session data, validate that the sign-up process includes proper data validation for required fields, email format checking, and duplicate account prevention, ensure that user profile completion guides new users through adding necessary information like contact details and preferences, check that authentication state persistence works correctly across browser sessions and device changes, verify that role-based redirection sends users to appropriate dashboards based on their permissions (staff to residents, admin to full platform), and confirm that the entire authentication flow maintains security best practices including HTTPS enforcement, secure cookie handling, and proper error message sanitization that doesn't expose sensitive information.
