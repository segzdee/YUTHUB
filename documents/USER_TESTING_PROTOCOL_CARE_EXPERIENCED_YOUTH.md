# User Testing Protocol: Care-Experienced Young People
## YUTHUB Platform - Trauma-Informed UX Validation

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: November 30, 2024  
**Status**: READY FOR ETHICS APPROVAL  
**Review Required**: University Ethics Committee, Safeguarding Team

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Purpose**: Validate YUTHUB's user experience design with care-experienced young people (ages 18-25) who have lived experience of supported housing.

**Why This Matters**:
- 16-21 year-olds in supported housing have often experienced trauma
- Many have had negative experiences with "systems" (social services, courts, schools)
- Digital literacy varies widely in this population
- Standard UX testing approaches may re-traumatize participants

**Key Principle**: **"Nothing About Us Without Us"** - Co-design with, not for, care-experienced youth

## 1. ETHICAL FRAMEWORK

### 1.1 Guiding Principles

**Trauma-Informed Approach** (SAMHSA, 2014):
1. **Safety**: Physical and psychological safety for all participants
2. **Trustworthiness**: Transparent about purpose, use of data
3. **Peer Support**: Option to bring support person
4. **Collaboration**: Participants as co-designers, not subjects
5. **Empowerment**: Emphasize participant expertise
6. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Responsive to diverse backgrounds

### 1.2 Ethical Approvals Required

☐ University Research Ethics Committee  
☐ Organizational Safeguarding Lead approval  
☐ Participant information sheet reviewed by plain English editor  
☐ Consent forms reviewed by legal team  
☐ DBS checks for all researchers  
☐ Safeguarding protocol in place

### 1.3 Participant Welfare

**Distress Protocol**:
- Researchers trained in trauma-informed practice
- Break encouraged every 20 minutes
- Option to stop at any time without explanation
- Debrief session after testing
- Signposting to support services provided

**Safeguarding**:
- If participant discloses abuse/harm: follow local safeguarding procedures
- Researcher contact details provided
- Independent complaints process
