## Independent Oversight for YUTHUB Platform

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: November 30, 2024  
**Status**: CONSTITUTION - READY FOR BOARD ESTABLISHMENT  
**Review**: Annual or upon request by 3+ members

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Purpose**: Establish independent ethics oversight for YUTHUB to ensure:
1. Algorithmic systems serve residents, not surveillance
2. Vulnerable population data protected to highest standards
3. Technology enhances, not replaces, human relationships
4. Power imbalances between staff and residents mitigated

**Key Principle**: **"Technology must be accountable to those it affects most"**

**Composition**: Majority care-experienced voices + multidisciplinary experts

---

## 1. MISSION & VALUES

### 1.1 Mission Statement

**To provide independent, expert oversight of YUTHUB's data practices, algorithmic systems, and technology design to ensure they uphold the rights, dignity, and autonomy of young people experiencing housing instability.**

### 1.2 Core Values

**1. Lived Experience Expertise**
- Care-experienced young people are the primary experts on what serves them
- Their voices carry equal weight to professional/technical expertise

**2. Transparency**
- All deliberations documented and (where appropriate) made public
- Decisions explained in plain language
- Conflicts of interest declared

**3. Accountability**
- Board has teeth: can block features, require changes
- Annual public report on platform ethics
- External audit of board effectiveness

**4. Intersectionality**
- Consider how technology affects people differently (race, disability, gender, etc.)
- Challenge one-size-fits-all approaches

**5. Precautionary Principle**
- If unsure about ethical implications: don't deploy until resolved
- "Move fast and break things" is incompatible with vulnerable populations

## 7. CASE STUDIES (HYPOTHETICAL)

### Case Study 1: Location Tracking Feature

**Proposal**: YUTHUB wants to add GPS tracking for "safeguarding" (know where residents are)

**Board Review**:
- **Care-Experienced Members**: "Feels like being spied on. Would make me feel distrusted."
- **Safeguarding Expert**: "Could be useful in missing person cases, but very intrusive."
- **Legal Expert**: "Likely disproportionate interference with Article 8 (privacy rights)."

**Decision**: **VETO** - Feature blocked unless:
1. Resident explicitly opts in (not default)
2. Only activated in emergency (e.g., missing person report)
3. Resident can disable at any time
4. Data automatically deleted after 24 hours

**Outcome**: YUTHUB redesigned feature with opt-in model. Board approved revised version.

---

### Case Study 2: Predictive Eviction Risk

**Proposal**: Algorithm flags residents "at risk of eviction" based on rent arrears, incidents, etc.

**Board Review**:
- **Data Scientist**: "What's the accuracy? Risk of false positives stigmatizing residents."
- **Housing Sector Rep**: "Could be helpful for early intervention if used sensitively."
- **Care-Experienced Members**: "Being flagged 'at risk' could become self-fulfilling prophecy."

**Decision**: **CONDITIONAL APPROVAL** with safeguards:
1. Flag only visible to assigned key worker (not managers/directors)
2. Triggers supportive conversation, not punitive action
3. Resident must be told if flagged (transparency)
4. Algorithm audited for bias (ethnicity, disability)
5. 6-month trial with resident feedback

**Outcome**: Implemented with safeguards. 6-month review found positive impact (early support) with no negative effects. Continued.

---

## 8. DISSOLUTION & COMPLAINTS

### 8.1 Board Dissolution

**Board can be dissolved if**:
- YUTHUB ceases operations
- 75% of board votes to dissolve (must publish reasons)

**Cannot be dissolved**:

### 8.2 Complaints About Board

**Internal Process**:
1. Complaint to Board Chair (in writing)
2. Chair investigates or appoints investigator
3. Response within 21 days
4. Appeal to full board if unsatisfied
